    <h2>Personal reflection on human augmentation:  </h2>

    <h4>I think there are many ethical issues related to human augmentation, especially in the area of enhancing human performance. This can be seen in performance enhancing drug usage within professional sports, or "doping". There is a taboo on the usage of performance enhancing drugs and it is banned in many if not most of the sporting competitions around the world, for example; olympic weightlifting. </h4>

    <h4>According to the NZ Herald, in the London 2012 Olympics, all three medal winners in the women's 75kg weightlifting division were stripped of their medals due to a positive drug test, and in the men's 95kg division, the gold medalist who broke two world records, was stripped of his medal as well. This shows the prominence of drug usage in weightlifting specifically, and the amount of medal winners who were revealed to be using drugs shows how these performance enhancing drugs are unethical in the sense that it gives an unfair advantage over other competitors to the user. </h4>

    <h4>However I believe there are many ethically sound uses for human augmentations to improve human performance. A simple example of this would be the usage of orthotics  such as a cast or moon boot, which are used to return to an individual albeit partially, the ability to carry out physical tasks that an injury prevented them from being able to perform. </h4>

    <h4>The use of human augmentation for educational purposes such as virtual reality and multidimensional learning I believe are also ethical ways to use human augmentation. These types of human augmentation do not give an unfair advantage to the ones using them such as performance enhancing drugs, but simply provide a better learning environment and can allow for better memory retention and improvement in recalling information that was provided during the usage of these technologies. </h4>

    <h4>I would personally recommend the usage of human augmentation to the extent where in a competitive environment, it does not simply give the advantage to one competitor over another, but can rather be used as a tool to gain the advantage through training and practicing.</h4>

    <h4>In the field of helping injured people or giving educational tools, I would definitely recommend more forms of human augmentation that provide different methods of learning and studying, as everybody learns differently and finding a method that suits the person could be the difference in what that person learns and what information they retain. </h4>
