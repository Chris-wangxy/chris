	</ul><h3><p>>>The human enhancement integrates nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science to improve human performance.<p></h3>

	</ul><h3><p>>>Human enhancement technology is committed to the development of cognitive enhancement, physiological enhancement.<p></h3>

	</ul><h3><p>>>In medicine, he is committed to the treatment of diseases and disabilities, nerve implants and brain-computer interface technology.<p></h3>
